    <h1>Screen-Printing</h1>
    <img src="SC.png" alt="bruhmoment" style="width: 150px;" style="height: 150px;">


	<p>D. Long and Company has a long history of serving Hardin County and the surrounding area with custom-made and high-quality prints. Each project is held to the highest standard, and we are committed to ensuring you love every single item made at D. Long & Co. From tank tops to hoodies, our professionals can print your custom designs on all types of apparel with a minimum order of just 12 items.</p>

  <h2 id="How">How Screen-Printing Works</h2>
	<P>To begin the screen printing process, every design is digitally separated into layers. These outline layers are later used to create the printing stencils. The original name for screen printing was actually “silk screening”, as frames used to be stretched with a mesh made of silk fibers which acted as the stencil material. Nowadays, this mesh screen is made of stronger, and more durable, synthetic fibers.</P>

	<p>For each stencil, an emulsion is evenly spread across the screen. Your design outline is laid over this surface and exposed to light, solidifying the emulsion material in every place except your outline. This area washes out to create a perfect stencil to begin printing.</p>

	<p>Each of our screen printed designs is printed manually so that you get a quality, hand-printed product every single time. Your choice of garment is laid underneath the stencil, and one of our professional printers uses a squeegee to press our plastisol ink through the open areas of mesh. This ink is incredibly long-lasting, vivid, and durable for years after printing. Once your design is fully printed, we cure the ink with heat, and your item is ready to wear!</p>

	<h1>Embroidery</h1>

	<p>Since 1993, D. Long & Co. has provided Hardin County with the best in custom embroidery. We can embroider a wide array of items from simple monograms to multi-colored logos.</p>


	<p>High-quality embroidery requires precise placement of thousands of stitches. Recreating the look of professional, commercial-quality embroidery by hand, or even with a standard sewing machine, can be incredibly time-consuming and difficult.  At D. Long and Co., we use a top-of-the-line embroidery machine to create beautiful, long-lasting needlework at an affordable price. We digitally enter your design into the machine with your choice of colors, and let the machine take over. Because our process is automated, we can quickly produce any number of made-to-order designs and styles.</p>

<h2 id="Embroidery">Sew Unique</h2>

<p>Take your business apparel to the next level and represent your business in style with custom embroidered designs. We can embroider your business name or logo onto t-shirts, polos, caps, and more to create unique, polished uniforms for you and your employees. What better way to advertise your business than with attention-grabbing embroidered apparel?</p>
 
<p>Because there is no minimum quantity for embroidery orders, you can personalize each item with a monogram, name, or special design to create the perfect gift for every occasion. Custom embroidery adds a personal touch that is perfect for baby showers, weddings, birthdays, housewarming parties, anniversaries, and other special days.</p>

<h1>Heatpress</h1>

<p>Nothing brings a team together like the sense of unity that comes from matching custom uniforms. Our vinyl heat press is perfect for making your custom jerseys and sportswear. From cheer squad apparel to football jerseys, your team will be ahead of the competition in personalized, high-quality uniforms.  We take your personalized information, cut it on our vinyl machine and press it onto the fabric or garment.  The heating process cements the graphic onto the apparel with a strong baked-in connection which creates a bond that will last through rough wear and tear.  The vinyl also has a small amount of elasticity, allowing for stretching or shrinking alongside the garment in multiple washes or rough-housing.</p>

<h2 id="Winning">Winning Combinations</h2>

<p>We use our heat press and vinyl transfer sheets to print team names, logos, and player numbers on your choice of apparel. Vinyl heat press creates a long-lasting and durable print on your garments that will stay strong wash after wash and year after year.</p>


<p>Our professional can also handle custom orders for vinyl heat press on bags, jackets, and more to create the perfect vinyl prints to fit your needs. Call or visit us today to put in your custom order.</p>

<h1>Awards</h1>

<p>For special occasions and great accomplishments, an award given at the right time can invigorate an employee, uplift a team member, and bring happiness to those whose recognition is in dire need.  Our styles for trophy plates include sublimation and laser-etched engraving.</p>

<h2 id= "Sublimation">Sublimation</h2>

<p>When you want custom keepsakes, awards, and more with complex or colorful designs, sublimation is the way to go. D. Long & Co. can create unique trophies, plaques, and medals with sublimation. From sports to pageants to company or school awards ceremonies, we create personalized commemorative items that look incredible and last a lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="Engraving">Engraving</h3>

<p>Nothing conveys quality and professionalism quite like custom engraving. D. Long & Company provides the engraving services perfect to create your new professional plaque or high-quality trophy.</p>

<p>Businesses benefit from the sleek and exceptional look of engraved name plaques and door signs. From the front desk to the conference room, engraving adds an element of distinction to every area of your business.</p>

<p>Transform life’s fleeting moments into a tangible record of achievements both big and small with engraved trophies, medals, and plaques. Whether you need a 1st place soccer trophy or a celebratory plaque for 20 years of dedicated service, we can create an exceptional award to commemorate your exceptional memories.</p>
